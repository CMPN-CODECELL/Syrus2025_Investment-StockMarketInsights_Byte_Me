# FinX-AI

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Developing an intelligent AI agent that can comprehensively analyze stock prices by integrating complex external factors beyond traditional fundamental analysis, including global market sentiments, geopolitical events, cross-asset correlations, social media discussions, and real-time economic indicators to provide holistic and predictive investment insights that human analysts cannot efficiently process or understand.


### Mentor Guidance:

- Asked to implement basic working of the flow of our AI-agent.
- Asked to implement Financial fundamental analysis, market sentiment analysis and Social media 
- Asked to implement Insights using the market sentiment analysis.

- We suggested implementation of RAG (Retrival Augmented Generation) for analyzing personal/enterprise portfolio and giving personalized insight. 


### DAY 1 OUTPUT
- Completed implementation of Financial fundamental analysis
- Getting the response for sentiment and social media analysis in JSON format in UPTIQ CONSOLE (Faced Network error while publishing).
- Work in progress on RAG implementation.

### DAY 2 OUTPUT (FINAL IMPLEMENTATION)
- video link: https://youtu.be/4oKsTP7BVhI
- Fundamental Analysis of any stock using Balance Sheets, P/L     statements, Cashflow data.
- Insights based on news successfully integrated into the main sub-agent.
- Successfully able to retrive the user's portfolio data from the Vector Database on UPTIQ CONSOLE.
- Able to predict the correlations between given stock and other related resources (eg. oil prices affect Airways stock)



### Note
We faced a "model not found" error while exporting the complete model, hence the zip file of the first draft is uploaded. The demo video has the complete implementation of our workflow.
